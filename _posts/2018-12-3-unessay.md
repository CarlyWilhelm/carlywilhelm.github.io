Throughout the semester, we have explored topics like productivity, digital reading, screen-time, and data collection. I wanted to combine these areas of interest in an Unessay that explores how people actually spend time on their phones. In class, we discussed several apps that can be downloaded with the purpose of honing screen time preferences or increasing productive time. In fact, the new software update for IOS has a setting called “Screen Time”, and when turned on, the setting tracks information about app use, notifications, and pickups. 

To complete my survey, I spoke to 19 people that ranged from ages 19 to 51, both males and females. I asked them if they had their Screen Time setting turned on, and if they would be willing to send me screenshots of their data. After receiving their information, I recorded each person’s data in separate Excel sheets. I chose to record all information that was possible through the app on Excel, then make the decision on what data to use in the Infographic. I noted each person’s total time spent, time spent on each app, notifications per day, pickups per day, notifications on each app, and day with the highest number of pickups. I was able to utilize several formulas I was familiar with in Excel (COUNTIF, SUM, AVG, VLOOKUP, DIV), which I enjoyed incorporating into my research. 

Often, data is assumed to be neutral and objective. However, my experience building the infographic showed me how I could utilize my data in ways that create and augment my argument.  First, I titled the infographic with a question, “Too Much Screen Time?”, with the aim of urging viewers to ask themselves that question when they are reading. I only included the average (3.44) and highest (4 hours 40 minutes) number of hours spent on the phone, but decided not to add the lowest number (which was only about 1 hour). Including this statistic would have counteracted my point, rather than assisting it. I also decided to end the infographic with the number of people who have the “App Time Limits” turned on. Only one person I surveyed shared that they had this setting turned on. Using the single person graphic emphasized this low number, especially when compared to the ten people earlier in the page. This statistic shows that while there are built-in tools that can help people navigate their screen time, very few users take advantage. I realized that by including, leaving out, or organizing data in a specific way. 

A successful essay takes into consideration counter-points and opposing arguments, and I kept this in mind as I created my Unessay. For example, many phone-users make the argument that cell phone use can be productive. To some extent this is true, as users can stay up to date on the news, read books, conduct research, or produce business emails. My research, however, showed otherwise. The most time was spent overwhelmingly on social media, with 58% of the pie chart comprised of Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook. This shows a distinct lack of productivity, and I selected a graphic that would highlight this for the viewer. Another counterpoint is that if “Do Not Disturb” is turned on, people would be less likely to pickup their phone. However, my research shows that the majority of people pickup their phone more times than they receive notifications. Although this may seem like an obscure data point to include, I felt as though it helped to show the innate nature of phone use. 

The aesthetic aspect of the infographic was something I did not consider before beginning. I wanted the colors to be interesting, yet still have the data be clear. I attempted a similar balance with the graphics, as I wanted it to be interesting, yet not sacrifice clarity. I realized that these decisions are similar to those in a regular essay, and each decision I made had purpose. 

Before I even collected my data, I had a hypothesis that the Screen Time setting would show not only a heavy usage of cell phones, but also a lack of productivity. I also suspected that those who looked at their data and sent me images would rethink their screen use, or proclaim that they were unaware of their high usage. Both of these hypotheses proved to be correct, and were reflected in my infographic.  The average was 3.44 hours, which comes out to about 14.3% of the day. As mentioned, the idea that social media apps comprised the highest timed apps countered the idea of productivity. The fact that only one person had app limits turned on shows that generally, people are either unaware of their usage or unwilling to change their practices. I also decided to use the quote that one participant shared with me, which highlights the way people may be completely ignorant of how they spend their time. The phone usage was so mindless that they had no idea they spent the majority of their phone time on Instagram. The quote served as a piece of evidence that again propelled my specific argument forward. 

Overall, I felt as though an infographic was a unique, digestive, and compelling way to show phone usage data. I’ve read several news articles or academic papers that explore a similar topic, however to me, this format fits the fast-paced reading that accompanies incessant phone use.
