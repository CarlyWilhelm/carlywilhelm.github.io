In our classroom discussion of Perez’s “UndocuDreamers: Public Writing and the Digital Turn”, we debated the potential risks and rewards of undocumented students voicing their stories in a public forum. In her essay, Perez was living through the debate, encouraging her students to write publicly, while also advocating for their safety. She articulates this conflict as she explains:

_“Their writing was raw and powerful, challenging, passionate and, at times, angry. These student blog posts seemed the classic case of students finding their voices. As an instructor, I was pleased with their work and gave them positive feedback, as did many of their classmates. Yet as their instructor, I was focused on the pedagogy and their learning outcomes relative to the course and had not fully considered the risk they were taking writing their truth in public.”_
 
It is easy for me – a white, privileged, college-educated, female – to encourage these students to speak freely; I don’t face the same risks they do and can’t do much to protect them. However, I do think there is a benefit for undocumented students to write publicly, sans pseudonym. In my opinion, attaching your real name to a piece of writing is the ultimate act of agency. It’s important for the public to know their stories, and often, it can be a cathartic experience for the writer as well. In the end, it is up to the student, and their decision to speak publicly or privately should be respected and upheld. 

Unsurprisingly, the intersection of public writing, digital portrayals, and potential risks is a space that is heavily discussed in other courses. In fact, this week in another class I read Sarah Friedland’s and Wendy Chung’s “Habits of Leaking: Of Sluts and Network Cards”. In their essay, the authors worked through issues of privacy and ownership that result from images that are published online. They work through the ways in which society is accustomed to blaming the ‘victim’ for what appears online, rather than those who do harm to the victim. They discuss why certain images are inherently deemed ‘irresponsible’, based on society’s opinions. Critics ask for the female to be silenced, instead of changing their own outlook. The following passage highlights this line of thinking:

_“It [the logic] does not ask why these images should be considered harmful, and it does not (or very rarely does it) provoke rigorous examination of networking and social protocols or the relationship between publicity and democracy” (Chung, Frieland3)._

Although the discussion here is about images, I feel that applying the same thoughts can be applied to public writing. In regard to Perez’s article we can ask similar questions; why should the student’s voice be silenced because of bigot-fueled rhetoric? Is the student or the commenter responsible for the negativity around the writing? Both of these situations highlight the need for a re-framing in the way we look at online spaces. Rather than placing blame on victims (women, undocumented students) for expressing themselves, we should be looking at why their representations bring on such derision.
